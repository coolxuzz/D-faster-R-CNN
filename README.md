## D-Faster R-CNN

D-Faster R-CNN: Medical Ultrasound Image Detection Based on Dual-branch Faster R-CNN Model

## Data

The proposed D-faster R-CNN is validated on the ultrasound dataset provided by [Al-Dhabyani et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340919312181). 

## Environment

Please prepare an environment with `python=3.8`, and then use the command

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 for the dependencies.
 
We set the batch size as 4 for the dataset on a GPU RTX4090D (24G).
